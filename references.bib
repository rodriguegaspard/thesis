The performance analysis of artificial neural network based â€“YcbCr skin recognition and three other techniques is evaluated in this work. Results obtained show that the use of YCbCr color model performs better than RGB colour model and the use of artificial neural network further improves the accuracy of the system.}

abstract = {In this paper, we introduce a hand gesture recognition system to recognize continuous gesture before stationary background. The system consists of four modules: a real time hand tracking and extraction, feature extraction, hidden Markov model (HMM) training, and gesture recognition. First, we apply a real-time hand tracking and extraction algorithm to trace the moving hand and extract the hand region, then we use the Fourier descriptor (FD) to characterize spatial features and the motion analysis to characterize the temporal features. We combine the spatial and temporal features of the input image sequence as our feature vector. After having extracted the feature vectors, we apply HMMs to recognize the input gesture. The gesture to be recognized is separately scored against different HMMs. The model with the highest score indicates the corresponding gesture. In the experiments, we have tested our system to recognize 20 different gestures, and the recognizing rate is above 90%.}
